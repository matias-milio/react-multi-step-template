# MULTI STEP FORM TEMPLATE DONE WITH REACT
The form itself does nothing but a demonstration of some sort of pattern to manage diferent forms within the same url and keeping state of the properties at all times.</br>
Maybe in the future I'll add some API functionality.</br>
This was one of my first proyects, sorry for the spanish names in the code.
